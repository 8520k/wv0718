  "q1.4": "Wolfwood and Vash have been promising to clean it for years.. It's still a mess.",
  "q1.5": "Nicholas let out a deep sigh.",
  "q1.6": "I need equipment to repair it.",
  "q1.6.1": "I need to go to the uncle's woodshop and borrow some tools.",
  "q1.7": "Examine the storage room",
  "q1.8": "Wow, look at the state of the floor.",

  "q1.14": "...I'm borrowing this for a second",
  "q1.14.1": "Press Confirm key at the right timing!",
  "q1.14.2": "If you nail the broken floor perfectly the repair will be successful!",
  "q1.14.3": "I'll show my skills.",
  "q1.15": "Hammer the nail at just the right moment!",
  "q1.16": "Should I fix this floor?",
  "q1.17": "Should I move this box?",
  "q1.18": "Phew, they said to move the boxes too.",
  "q1.19": "This will be done quickly.",
  "q1.20": "...?",
  "q1.21": "…Well, he hasn’t changed a bit since then.",
  "q1.22": "Nicholas carefully put away the [photo].",
  "q1.23": "...",
  "q1.24": "Uncle Livio?",
  "q1.25": "Hmm, it looks good now that it's fixed.",
  "q1.26": "Ugh... it's not as easy as I thought..",
  "q1.27": "A pile of stuff I remember seeing since childhood",
  "q1.28": "I used it as cover when playing hide and seek with Spikey",
  "q1.29": "Heh.. this is easy!",
  "q1.30": "Hmm.. let me catch my breath.",
  "q1.31": "A photo fell from between the boxes.",
  "q1.32": "Wow~ the room became sparkling clean!",
  "q1.33": "Instead of using it as storage we could rent it out?",
  "q1.34": "Who are you planning to let in?",
  "q1.35": "Well..? Livio perhaps?",
  "q1.36": "Uncle isn't married?",
  "q1.37": "Oh my, did he seem to have someone good?",
  "q1.38": "...",
  "q1.39": "...",
  "q1.40": "They awkwardly left the storage room",
  "q2.1": "Gardening geraniums",
  "q2.2": "I don't know much about flowers, I should ask mother.",
  "q2.3": "At this time Vash must be in the field.",
  "q2.4": "Talk to Vash in the field",
  "q2.5": "Welcome, Nico~ How's the task Wolfwood gave you going?",
  "q2.6": "Well, I don't know why he suddenly gave me this kind of task.",
  "q2.7": "Hehe, isn't it all for Nico's sake?",
  "q2.8": "I don't think so...",
  "q2.9": "Come on, you need to plant flowers anyway?",
  "q2.10": "These are geranium seeds. Take them!",
  "q2.11": "Obtained [Geranium Seed Pouch].",
  "q2.12": "Geraniums are strong plants that can bloom in any season.",
  "q2.13": "The flower’s meaning is ‘determination.’ It fits perfectly, doesn’t it?",
  "q2.14": "Just because you plant them today doesn't mean they'll grow and bloom right away..",
  "q2.15": "Who knows, maybe a miracle will happen if you put your love into it?",
  "q2.16": "Yeah yeah, even if you don't say that I'll plant them quickly~",
  "q2.17": "So cold… Nico’s gone and turned into a grown-up...",
  "q2.18": "Anyway, you can plant the seeds after digging the ground lightly with your hands.",
  "q2.19": "There's a field on the left side of the house.",
  "q2.20": "It'll be wonderful when the geranium flowers bloom all over!",
  "q2.21": "Let me know when you're done planting!",
  "q2.22": "Should I plant seeds here?",
  "q2.23": "I buried the seeds well.",
  "q2.24": "You finished quickly! Good job, Nico~",
  "q2.25": "Is it done now?",
  "q2.26": "Huh? Of course you need to water them so the seeds can sprout!",
  "q2.27": "Ah right.. then please give me a watering can.",
  "q2.28": "Yes, that's what we need to do, but the thing is~",
  "q2.29": "(I have a bad feeling about this...)",
  "q2.30": "This morning I was watering the field and tripped over a tree root",
  "q2.31": "The watering can spout broke right off!",
  "q2.32": "So I asked Wolfwood to fix it",
  "q2.33": "He said he needed materials we don't have at home and took it away!",
  "q2.33.1": "Why are my worst hunches always right…?",
  "q2.33.2": "Huh? What did you say Nico?",
  "q2.33.3": "Oh, nothing. Then where is father?",
  "q2.34": "Wolfwood probably went to the village! Go look for him!",
  "q2.35": "Yes.. I'll go and come back.",
  "q2.35.1": "What do you think about raising crayfish in the pond?",
  "q2.35.2": "Crayfish? Why do you suddenly want to raise crayfish..?",
  "q2.35.3": "Well they're red..",
  "q2.35.4": "…",
  "q2.35.5": "And they're red",
  "q2.35.6": "… … …",
  "q2.35.7": "Because they're red?",
  "q2.35.8": "Mom, crayfish only turn red when cooked, you know?",
  "q2.35.9": "…!!?",
  "q2.36": "Weird… I definitely lost it here...",
  "q2.37": "…?",
  "q2.37.1": "Spikey, what are you doing here?",
  "q2.38": "Kyaaah!",
  "q2.39": "Geez, why are you screaming!",
  "q2.40": "S-sorry.. I didn't know it was you...",
  "q2.46": "So what are you doing? Did you lose something?",
  "q2.47": " Yes, I lost something precious around here yesterday..",
  "q2.48": "What is it?",
  "q2.49": "… … …",
  "q2.50": "..A pendant necklace.",
  "q2.51": "The same gold color as my earrings, a bit old..",
  "q2.52": "...Is that something you really treasure?",
  "q2.53": "Huh? Yes.. it's something I've treasured since long ago.",
  "q2.54": "Nicholas silently rolled up his sleeves and entered the bushes.",
  "q2.55": "N-Nicholas..?",
  "q2.56": "Don't just stand there. If it's precious we need to find it.",
  "q2.57": "Y-yes! Thank you…",
  "q2.58": "Sigh… did you really drop it here?",
  "q2.59": "Yes… this is the right place…",
  "q2.60": "Sorry.. Nicholas, It's because of me...",
  "q2.61": "W-why are you crying? I'm not angry!",
  "q2.62": "But I'm the one who lost the necklace, I'm the one who made Nicholas suffer, I'm the one who...",
  "q2.63": "You should listen carefully when someone is talking to you.",
  "q2.64": "You're the one who lost it, but I'm the one who said I'd find it.",
  "q2.65": "How is that your fault?",
  "q2.66": "Don't try to take responsibility for everything. Nobody will appreciate it even if you do.",
  "q2.67": "… … …",
  "q2.67.1": "… … … ciates it..",
  "q2.68": "What?",
  "q2.69": "You appreciates it.",
  "q2.70": "…!! W-what are you saying?! When did I?!",
  "q2.71": "Meow-",
  "q2.72": "What’s that cat that always comes to my house for food doing here?",
  "q2.73": "Oh, that..! My necklace!",
  "q2.74": "Really?! Catch that cat!",
  "q2.75": "Stop right there - !!",
  "q2.76": "….!!!",
  "q2.77": "Ouch.. Nicholas, are you okay...?",
  "q2.78": "…Y-you..you..!!!!!!!",
  "q2.79": "Eh..?",
  "q2.80": "Why are you two like this?",
  "q2.81": "Oh, Mr. Wolfwood! That cat..!!",
  "q2.82": "Ah~ That one brought something again.",
  "q2.83": "A necklace? You didn’t steal it from somewhere, did you? There's something inside.",
  "q2.84": "Oh, Mr. W-Wolfwood! Wait a sec...!",
  "q2.85": "Well... The owner was right in front of me. How embarrassing..",
  "q2.86": "… … … … …",
  "q2.86.1": "… ?",
  "q2.87": "Sorry for touching it without permission. Here, take it.",
  "q2.88": "Stampede snatched the pendant from Wolfwood's hand and disappeared without saying goodbye.",
  "q2.89": "…..? …..??????",
  "q2.90": "Didn’t I say I’d help you?",
  "q2.91": "W-what are you talking about?! Just give me the watering can!!!",
  "q2.92": "Yeah yeah-",
  "q2.92.1": "(Can’t tell if these kids are moving fast or taking it slow.)",
  "q2.92.2": "Got the watering can from Wolfwood. Let's go back to Vash!",
  "q2.93": "Nico~ Why did it take so long?",
  "q2.94": "Did something happen on the way?",
  "q2.95": "...Nothing happened. Here, I brought the watering can.",
  "q2.96": "Thanks! It's completely fixed~",
  "q2.97": "Should I water it now?",
  "q2.98": "Oh, actually, since you didn't come for so long...",
  "q2.98.1": "… … …",
  "q2.98.2": "… … … … …",
  "q2.99": "I already watered them all!",
  "q2.100": "………What?",
  "q2.101": "The watering can is right here.. what did you use...??",
  "q2.102": "Ah~ I looked around and found another one in the storage!",
  "q2.103": "…",
  "q2.104": "Ehehe, sorry...~",
  "q2.105": "..Well... it's fine... as long as you watered them... sigh...",
  "q2.106": "(Did I make him suffer too much...? But I couldn't help it. Sorry, Nico...!)",
  "q2.106.1": "Come on, come on~ Let's go home~",
  "q2.107": "Imagine a flower field spreading wide~ Isn't it enchanting?",
  "q2.108": "Today you earned your keep. Ask Spikey for some snacks as a reward.",
  "q3.1": "Chopping firewood",
  "q3.2": "Chopping firewood was father's job..",
  "q3.3": "Aren’t they just going to dump the work on me?",
  "q3.4": "Let's go to the forest first.",
  "q3.5": "Let's find Wolfwood's axe in the forest",
  "q3.16": "Father's axe should be somewhere around here...",
  "q3.17": "Obtained [Old Axe].",
  "q3.18": "The condition is a bit off...",
  "q3.18.1": "It's used every day so it should be fine.",
  "q3.19": "Now I need to find some trees.",
  "q3.19.1": "Chopping trees in the forest",
  "q3.20": "Alright, time to flex my muscles.",
  "q3.21": "Press spacebar to hit the target",
  "q3.22": "If you chop the tree accurately with the axe you GET firewood!",
  "q3.23": "Whew~ It falls down nicely.",
  "q3.23.1": "There don't seem to be any more useful trees here.",
  "q3.23.2": "Let's go to the next area.",
  "q3.24": "Hmm.. my hand slipped.",
  "q3.25": "It'll be different if I try again.",
  "q3.26": "This should be enough. I should chop in the forest closest to home since it's easier to carry, so I'll go there.",
  "q3.27": "Phew.. maybe because it's the inner forest the trees are really tough..",
  "q3.27.1": "... ?!!",
  "q3.27.2": "The axe handle broke and my hand got cut on the broken edge.",
  "q3.28": "Argh..!!!",
  "q3.29": "Damn... it's broken. I thought the handle seemed off.",
  "q3.30": "Look at this blood, I'm going to get scolded by Vash again...",
  "q3.31": "Nicholas?",
  "q3.32": "Oh, Spikey. What are you doing here?",
  "q3.33": "Uh-huh, picking blueberries...",
  "q3.33.1": "Oh, Nicholas?! Your hand is bleeding..!",
  "q3.34": "Are you okay?! The wound is too big...",
  "q3.35": "Well... Just spit on it—it’ll be fine.",
  "q3.36": "What are you saying! It'll get infected even worse!",
  "q3.37": "(This is the first time I've seen him raise his voice like this..)",
  "q3.38": "Y-yeah...",
  "q3.39": "Give me your hand.",
  "q3.40": "….!!!",
  "q3.41": "It's urgent so let's disinfect it at home. Let's stop the bleeding...",
  "q3.42": "I-it's fine. I'll handle it myself...!",
  "q3.43": "Don't move. I need to tie it tightly.",
  "q3.44": "Stampede firmly ties a handkerchief around Nicholas's hand.",
  "q3.45": "...The handkerchief got ruined. I'll buy you a new one.",
  "q3.46": "It's okay. Blood comes out quickly if I wash it with lukewarm water.",
  "q3.47": "...When it's all healed, please come return it.",
  "q3.48": "....Y-yeah.. ...I will.",
  "q3.49": "Stampede realizes he got too close without knowing it and backs away with a red face.",
  "q3.50": "T-then I'll be going now!",
  "q3.50.1": "You need to go home and disinfect it properly!",
  "q3.51": "… … …",
  "q3.51.1": "This should be enough firewood.",
  "q3.51.2": "I should probably get back to home.",
  "q3.52": "It's Wolfwood's axe.",
  "q3.53": "Maybe because it's bothersome to carry around, he often leaves it here.",

  "s2.40.3": "Come to think of it where did I put the errand note?",
  "s2.41": "It's a grave of unknown identity",
  "s2.42": "I asked Vash before whose grave it was, but he said it's not used anymore..",

  "s3.21": "Was it the day you got scolded badly by your dad for the first time?",
  "s3.22": "You carved a bird then too. It was a mess though!",
  "s3.23": "That was more than 10 years ago. Please stop it..",

  "s3.34": "I should be going now.",
  "s3.35": "Alright~ You worked hard today too. Come visit anytime if you have worries again!",
  "s3.36": "Nicholas? Do you happen to have something you want to consult me about?",
